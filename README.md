.custom_commands
================
This project is where I keep some of my custom commands.  They're shortcuts for many of the bash command line commands that I use frequently.

Usage
-------------------
The project adds aliases to be sourced and updates the path in a file loaded by your shell.
This file is `~/.bash_profile` by default.

If you're using bash and you would like this file updated, run `./initialize.sh`.
If you're using zsh, you should run `./initialize.sh ~/.zshrc`.
